# base-fs-rename [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/base-fs-rename.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/base-fs-rename) [![NPM downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/base-fs-rename.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/base-fs-rename) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/node-base/base-fs-rename.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/node-base/base-fs-rename)

Plugin for 'base' applications that adds a `rename` method that, when called, can be passed to `app.dest()` as the rename function (this is an instance plugin, not pipeline plugin)

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install base-fs-rename --save
```

## Usage

Requires either the [base-fs](https://github.com/node-base/base-fs) or the [assemble-fs](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-fs) plugin to work.

```js
var fs = require('base-fs');
var rename = require('base-fs-rename');
var Base = require('base');
var app = new Base();

app.use(rename());
app.use(fs());

app.src('fixtures/a.txt')
  // pass `app.rename()` to `app.dest()`
  .pipe(app.dest(app.rename('actual')));
```
